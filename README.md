## What Is This Project?

I wanted to get some experience programming while also refusing the coddling
hand that VC-backed notes apps offer.

My plan is to create a system where I can quickly take and organize notes in
NeoVim and have saves be automatically synced to a database. I want to then
be able to access these notes in an organized manner on my phone.

Currently I am being assisted by Chat-GPT since this is the first project I've
done on this scale.
